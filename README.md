# Eslint

## Let's learn a VS Code Setting

`"files.eol": "\n",`
Eol stands for end of line character. The \n means that it would be if you want you file to have Unix style endings. Therefore “files.eol” : “\n”, would mean that it is for line endings in that file and that it would have Unix style endings.

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The no-trailing-spaces rule is very important because it lets the coder know that they have extra spaces at the end of their code. These spaces are either made with an extra tab pr space. This function is important because it disallows these extra spaces and lets your code not be flagged or picked up by source control systems.
